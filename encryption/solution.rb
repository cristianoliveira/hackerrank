# An English text needs to be encrypted using the following encryption scheme.
# First, the spaces are removed from the text. Let L be the length of this text.
# Then, characters are written into a grid, whose rows and columns have the following constraints:

# âˆš L < rows < cols, where x is floor function and x is ceil function
# For example, the sentence `if man was meant to stay on the ground god would have given us roots`
# after removing spaces is  characters long, 54 so it is written in the form of a grid with 7 rows and 8 columns.
